Democracy is a fundamental concept in most studies on politics and governance, at a national and international level, and it has increasingly become a focus of research within the context of the Middle East. In this region, varying political dynamics and systems shape citizen’s trust in state institutions. This paper seeks to answer the question: What are the strongest factors affecting a person’s opinion on the suitability of democracy for Jordan? This question gains importance in the face of Jordan’s unique political landscape, where the monarchy’s influence intersects with local and international pressures for democratization. It is important to note that the Arab Spring protests in Jordan demanded a government reform, not necessarily a regime change. Additionally, while the latest amendments to its constitution between 2011 and 2016 distributed power among various public servants and institutions, the king still had executive power. By understanding the factors that encourage or discourage a desire for a full democracy in Jordanian citizens, policymakers and researchers can better gauge public sentiment and identify pathways to more effective governance and representation.
