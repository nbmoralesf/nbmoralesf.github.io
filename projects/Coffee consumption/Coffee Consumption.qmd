This project models coffee consumption as a function of age and sleep using a linear equation based on external research and assumptions. Implemented in Mathematica, the model estimates annual consumption and visualizes how it varies across age and sleep ranges using a 3D surface plot. To analyze long-term impact, I used Riemann sums and integrals to compute total consumption between ages 18 and 70, yielding an estimated 12,000 cups over a lifetime.

Additionally, I calculated the average coffee consumption between ages 30 and 50 using the definite integral of the function, resulting in a value of 230 cups per year. These tools allowed me to transform a simple behavioral pattern into a quantitative analysis of daily habits. While the model is limited by its linear assumptions and scope, it effectively demonstrates how calculus can provide insight into lifestyle-driven data over time.
