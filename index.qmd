### Welcome to my portfolio!

::: {#intro-heading}
This website displays my projects and experience in college-level research. I am a third-year student at Macalester College pursuing a double major in Data Science and Political Science. I am part of the 2025 Chuck Green Fellowship cohort and the current chair of Macalester Adelante! student organization.\
\
I am passionate about combining my data analytics skills with my public policy knowledge to create responsible, data-driven solutions for political and social issues of the modern world. I approach problem-solving with a global outlook and a focus on collaboration, valuing strong, meaningful relationships within a team.
