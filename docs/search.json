    "text": "As the refugee population grows every day, the education systems are less prepared to integrate these new neighbors as students. Despite this, Jordan’s effort and dedication to improving the access and quality of the education that the refugee population receives. Based on the results and findings of UNESCO’s study, along with the IIEP and the Education Development Trust, Teacher Management in Refugee Settings: Public Schools in Jordan, this Policy Brief aims to provide context and guidance regarding the management and elementary-level teachers for public schools focused on Syrian refugees. The document intends to be a base and support for key collaborators of the Jordanian Ministry of Education in the process of creation and improvement of teacher management policies. The goal is to ensure a “high-quality, inclusive, and equitable education system”.\n\n\n Download Policy Brief (PDF)"

    "section": "",
    "text": "Democracy is a fundamental concept in most studies on politics and governance, at a national and international level, and it has increasingly become a focus of research within the context of the Middle East. In this region, varying political dynamics and systems shape citizen’s trust in state institutions. This paper seeks to answer the question: What are the strongest factors affecting a person’s opinion on the suitability of democracy for Jordan? This question gains importance in the face of Jordan’s unique political landscape, where the monarchy’s influence intersects with local and international pressures for democratization. It is important to note that the Arab Spring protests in Jordan demanded a government reform, not necessarily a regime change. Additionally, while the latest amendments to its constitution between 2011 and 2016 distributed power among various public servants and institutions, the king still had executive power. By understanding the factors that encourage or discourage a desire for a full democracy in Jordanian citizens, policymakers and researchers can better gauge public sentiment and identify pathways to more effective governance and representation.\n Download Report (PDF)"

    "text": "YouTube has become a prominent platform in which creators from diverse backgrounds and with diverse intentions choose to share their work. We initiated this research project after noticing compelling content on certain YouTube channels that, despite their potential for wider acclaim, haven’t received the recognition they merit, or on the other hand, seem to receive more recognition than what one would expect. This observation sparked our interest in understanding the factors that influence the popularity of a YouTube channel. Our research question for this project poses the inquiry of What is the relationship between a YouTuber’s category and their popularity, as measured by the number of subscribers and video views? Our goal with this research is to uncover the primary elements that contribute to a YouTube channel’s success and to identify if a channel’s category and content type are influential factors. From an individual content creator perspective, insights into popularity factors can contribute to strategy for audience engagement and the enhancement of visibility and impact of the desired content. From a broader point of view, understanding these relationships can contribute to the understanding of media culture and digital trends and influence. This is a comprehensive analysis to identify strategies for boosting a channel’s popularity.\n Download Report (PDF)"

    "section": "",
    "text": "In this project, 48 of Madonna’s songs that reached the Billboard Top 100 were analyzed, using unsupervised machine learning techniques to uncover patterns in her musical style. We used hierarchical clustering and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on 11 audio features obtained from the Spotify API—such as danceability, tempo, acousticness, and valence—to group the songs by similarity. After scaling the data, clustering revealed 7 musically distinct clusters, ranging from upbeat dance tracks to theatrical ballads, including unique outliers that stood apart from her mainstream catalog.\nPCA helped reduce dimensionality while preserving interpretability, with the first two components explaining approximately 36% of the variance. These components revealed that tempo and valence—both linked to a song’s emotional tone and energy—were key characteristics in her most successful tracks. This analysis provides a data-driven framework for understanding Madonna’s stylistic range and could help inform playlist creation or music recommendation systems, as well as audience-targeted music production.\nView Report"

    "section": "",
    "text": "This project models coffee consumption as a function of age and sleep using a linear equation based on external research and assumptions. Implemented in Mathematica, the model estimates annual consumption and visualizes how it varies across age and sleep ranges using a 3D surface plot. To analyze long-term impact, I used Riemann sums and integrals to compute total consumption between ages 18 and 70, yielding an estimated 12,000 cups over a lifetime.\nAdditionally, I calculated the average coffee consumption between ages 30 and 50 using the definite integral of the function, resulting in a value of 230 cups per year. These tools allowed me to transform a simple behavioral pattern into a quantitative analysis of daily habits. While the model is limited by its linear assumptions and scope, it effectively demonstrates how calculus can provide insight into lifestyle-driven data over time.\n Download Report (PDF)"
